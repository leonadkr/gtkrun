gtkrun is a program launcher for X (Wayland and others supported by Gtk4). In functionality it is similar to 'grun', but uses Gtk4.

You need cmake to build it.

To build:
cmake -S gtkrun -B /tmp/gtkrun/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=GlibToolChain.cmake

To install:
DESTDIR=$HOME/.local cmake --build /tmp/gtkrun/release --config Release --target install
